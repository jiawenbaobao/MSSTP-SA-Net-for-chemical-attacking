This repository focuses on situational awareness of security areas in biochemical attacked indoor scenarios based on deep learning technology. The CFD software --STAR-CCM+ is applied to simulate a mass of release scenarios that covers cases as much as possible. Especially, the indoor monitoring sensors are all arranged on the wall in CFD simulation scenarios, and a decontamination device is provided for manufacturing safe areas. When the neural network is properly trained, the model could estimate the indoor gas concentrationâ€™s field and the trend of safe areas in the future time periods without providing any information about the release source.
